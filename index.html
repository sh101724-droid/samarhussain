    <h1>99 Nights in the forest</h1><br>

<h2> What is 99 nights in the forest?</h2><br>

    <p>99 nights in the forest is a game about... litterally what it sounds like. In this game, you are supposed to rescue people and uncover the secrets of the forest, all in 99 nights.</p><br>
<h2> What are the objectives of 99 nights in the forest </h2><br>
<p> The objectives of 99 nights in the forest are to find the 4 missing children, get your campfire to level 6 (which reveals the whole map) and protect your base from invaders, sent by the main antagionist, the deer.</p><br>

<h2> What is the deer?</h2><br>

<p> The deer is one out of 5 of the antagonists of the game,<br>
he is the main antagonist of the game. Earlier I mentioned the "base invaders" But these aren't the real name of the enemy.<br>
The base invaders are actually called cultists and they try to sacrifice you to the deer becuase they worship it. The deer has long antlers and has a wide open mouth. It also stands on 2 legs<br>
The deer is scared of the fire, and the cultists try to put it out. The deer chases you in the game and gets stronger and faster as you try and survive it. The only thing that can stop it is light. ex. flashlight or your campfire<br>
More of the deer will be revealed later.</p><br>

<h2> Who are teh other 5 other entities?
