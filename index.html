<h2> What is 99 nights in the forest?</h2>

    <p>99 nights in the forest is a game about... litterally what it sounds like. In this game, you are supposed to rescue people and uncover the secrets of the forest, all in 99 nights.</p><br>
<h2> What are the objectives of 99 nights in the forest </h2>
<p> The objectives of 99 nights in the forest are to find the 4 missing children, get your campfire to level 6 (which reveals the whole map) and protect your base from invaders, sent by the main antagionist, the deer.</p><br>

<h2> What is the deer?</h2>

<p> The deer is one out of 5 of the antagonists of the game,<br>
he is the main antagonist of the game. Earlier I mentioned the "base invaders" But these aren't the real name of the enemy.<br>
The base invaders are actually called cultists and they try to sacrifice you to the deer becuase they worship it. The deer has long antlers and has a wide open mouth. It also stands on 2 legs<br>
The deer is scared of the fire, and the cultists try to put it out. The deer chases you in the game and gets stronger and faster as you try and survive it. The only thing that can stop it is light. ex. flashlight or your campfire<br>
More of the deer will be revealed later.</p><br>

<h2> Who are the entities abilities?</h2>

    <p> There are multiple different entities in 99 nights in the forest. The main one is the deer, as we said before. These entities are, the owl, the deer, the ram, the frog king, the bat<br>
    All these entities have abilities.<br>
        The owl's ability is that its the 2nd, fastest entity in the game and it causes you to stop moving.<br>
        The ram's ability is that it can ram into people and it's increased strength.<br>
        The Frog kings ability is that he can give you the poison effect by hitting you with his tongue. He is also the only entity who can be killed.<br>
        The bat's ability is that he can shriek and that makes you take about 25% damage. He can also summon shadow cultist amd a juggernaut shadow cultist.<br>
        The deer's ability is that the longer it chases you, the more speed and strength it gains.<br>
        It also gains more strength and speed as the days pass.<br>
        And finally, the deer can become hungry, which boosts its speed and hunger by a lot, making it the fastest entity in the game.<br> </p>

        <h2> What is the story of 99 nights in the forest?</h2>

    <p> One day, there was a mother and four kids. She was a pilot,<br>
        She took her kids for a ride in her plane and was flying over a forest.<br>
        Soon, the plane lost fuel, and came down with a crashing boom.<br>
        The kids thought their mother had died in the crash,but they were wrong.<br>
        The mother had survived and on the day of the crash, some scientists<br>
        had abducted her. These scientists were trying to see if the experiment<br>
        They had been working on would work. The experiment they were doing<br>
        Was illegal so they had to hide it. So they hid their lab in the<br>
        forest. Their experiment was metamorphisis. They had kidnapped <br>
        the mother, to morph her into a deer! The reason they wanted to do this<br>
        was because in the snowy part of the forest. There was a owl demon<br>
        That lived there. It's name was Stolas. The scientists don't know<br>
        How a real life demon existed. So they tried to capture it.<br>
        Some scientists knew that capturing Stolas was impossible,<br>
        So they decided to worship it. They became the first cultists<br>
        The scientists tried many times to try and capture Stolas, but<br>
        Stolas was too strong. Then they decided to summon another monster<br>
        One Stolas was scared off to beat it. and after they summoned<br>
        it, they could banish it back to the place it came from. so they <br>
        summoned it at a ancient volcano, which was near the forest.<br>
        The scientists had summoned an evil ram god to fight stolas<br>
        And it did. Stolas lost the battle. But the ram was going out<br>
        of control. So they banished it as fast as they could.<br>
        The ram and the owl (stolas) had lost a lot of energy after<br>
        the fight, so they both went into a deep sleep. Then the <br>
        scientists thought that it would be helpfull to have there<br>
        own monster to control and fight for them. So that's why<br>
        they kidnapped the mother, to turn her into the next<br>
        monster, the deer.<br>
        <br>
